<center><h2><font color="white">What is DroidID?</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">DroidID is an Android app that allows you to unlock your Mac by using the fingerprint sensor on your Android device, making unlocking your Mac more secure and convenient. It does not support PCs at the moment, but will do in the near future.</font></p>

    <h2><font color="white">How do I use DroidID?</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">Using DroidID is extremely simple. You first need to download the Android app to your phone, and the Mac app to your Mac and then open the app on both your phone and Mac. The Android app will give you a simple 6 character authentication code that you need to enter on the Mac app, along with your Mac login password (don't worry, it's stored securely on your Mac's keychain) and then press Connect to complete the setup. That's it! To unlock your Mac, you just need to press on the unlock notification on your Android phone (it always stays on the notification panel), scan your fingerprint and your Mac will be unlocked within seconds.</font></p>

    <h2><font color="white">Is DroidID itself secure?</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">Absolutely. There's no transmission of sensitive data, the app simply sends a command to the Mac app telling it to unlock the lockscreen using your login password, which is itself stored securely on your Mac's keychain.</font></p>

    <h2><font color="white">What are the requirements for using the app?</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">You need (1) an Android device running Marshmallow or above, or a Samsung device running Lollipop or above (2) Fingerprint sensor on your Android device, and (3) Any Mac running El Capitan or above</font></p>

    <h2><font color="white">From where do I download the Mac app?</font></h2>
    <p><font color="white">You can download it from: suyashsrijan.com/droidid</font></p>

    <h2><font color="white">The app does not unlock my Mac!</font></h2>

DroidID will not unlock your Mac (1) On boot-up (2) If you manually lock your Mac (by clicking your name on status bar and selecting 'Login Window....'</font></p>
